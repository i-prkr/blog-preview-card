## My process

I really wanted to try creating the component and design using the css grid layout system. Due to this I spent some time refreshing on the css grid display, and then creating the grid on the canvas so that while creating the component I could see it mapped to the grid. Once I had the grid, then created the component and tried to use the grid to help with sizing as well as to help with responsive design for different screen sizes. I spent more time than expected just playing around with the grid, trying to work out the best way to handle responsive design and get it working properly.

In short the process was:

1. Create the css grid display and the card against it.
2. Create the elements within the card and layout.
3. Style the elements correctly and position them.
4. Add responsive design working with the grid-template to change size appropraitely for different screen sizes.
5. Add the focus effects for when hovering over the card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I was able to refresh on how the css grid works, and spent a lot of time playing around with it trying to get the component to size correctly, particularly with different screen sizes. The @media queries in css is not someting I had worked with much, and so I learned alot playing around with them in combination with the css grid.

I also learned the nesting features in pure css, and tried to make use of that in keeping maintable and easy to read css code.

### Continued development

I really need to continue working with media queries and making things responsive in an effective way. I'm not sure that my eventual solution after the time spent is the best solution for responsiveness with css grid.

I also want to start learning and using more css frameworks, and begin experimenting with either Sass or Tailwind.
